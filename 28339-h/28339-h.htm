Johnson’s definition of a dedicator, “one who inscribes his work

any quarter, <i>you</i> would resent as an indignity, and the
tenor of my own life and writings will secure me from the
imputation of <i>servile</i> deference to others, with whatever
reverence I may contemplate their rank, their talents, or their

<p class="pns">When, Sir, under unusual circumstances, I engaged

<p class="pns">In respectfully presenting to your attention this
short treatise, I do not prejudge your opinion of its contents,
whether favourable or adverse. The responsibility rests

displeasing to a dignified clergyman, who has firmly professed
his attachment to the great principles of the Church in times
more dangerous to her interests, and more difficult for her
ministers, than any which have heretofore occurred since the

<hr style="width:15%;margin-top:1.5em;margin-bottom:1.5em">
<p class="pnn">T<span class="sc">hat</span> strenuous attempts
are now in progress to propagate Calvinism in its most
objectionable forms, by impressing into its service that spirit
of earnest, but often misinformed piety which has been awakened
within the bosom of the Church, is too notorious to require proof
or to admit of refutation.</p>
<p class="pn">The following sheets have been written, and are now
published, under the solemn conviction, that the danger to be
apprehended from the extensive diffusion of this creed, both to
religion and the Church, renders it impossible that it should be
allowed to pursue its unmolested course, without correspondent
efforts, on the part of sound Churchmen, to counteract its
baleful influence.</p>
<p class="pn">Superstition, which lays undue stress on outward
forms, and fanaticism, which gives credit to preternatural
impulses, and professes a particular kind of inspiration
differing not at all from infallibility, are the Scylla and
Charybdis, through which, over stormy waters or serene, we have
to make our steady way. Both are equally intolerant, and both are
condemned by the genius of Protestantism, the constitution of the
Church, and the spirit of the Bible.</p>
<p class="pn">It is devoutly to be desired, that none who are
more regardful of truth than of party, that none who are alive to
the real state of the times, and to the character of the
respective interests which may hereafter be brought into unhappy
collision, may hesitate, through fear or favour, to act in this
crisis with moral courage tempered with holy charity. Let them
discountenance all extreme innovations, from whatsoever quarter
they may proceed, or by whatsoever distinguished names they may
be sanctioned. Let them rise with manly integrity above the mean
suggestions of temporizing policy, and look only to the
substantial and permanent interests of the Church, which are
those of truth and charity, of freedom in alliance with order, of
Christianity in its most ennobling form, and of the public
welfare of the British Empire.</p>
<p class="pn">If the spirit of rigid Calvinism, under any
plausible disguise, should be widely diffused through the
Anglican Church, we need no prophetic mind to announce, that it
will lead to consequences fatal to her peace and liberty,
introducing a spiritual despotism whose power will be felt
throughout the length and breadth of the land, overawing, as in
the days of John Knox, the majesty of princes, and spreading its
morbid gloom to the sequestered cottage of the peasant, in the
remotest regions and most unfrequented provinces.</p>
<p class="pn">History proves, that the men who are deeply imbued
with this spirit, merge all other interests in their devoted zeal
to its propagation.</p>
<p class="pn">Those of that party who, like Mr. Noel, think “our
venerable Church” means no more than “our venerable
<i>selves</i>,” will be ready to betray her into the hands of her
adversaries, whensoever they may be deemed strong enough to carry
her outworks, and to supplant the orthodox clergyman by the
Calvinistic minister;—while those who reverence the Apostolical
succession, or the general order of the Church, will form within
our pale an intolerant party, intriguing for dominion, restless
and oppressive, never to be satisfied until they have crushed or
excluded all who have dared to profess their rejection of the
Calvinistic theology.</p>
<p class="pn">In the spirit already exemplified by the Pastoral
Aid Society, for the detection of whose sectarian principles we
are indebted to the Christian courage of Dr. Molesworth, they
will throw obstacles in the way of candidates for ordination or
parochial cures, if they come not up to the doctrinal standard of
their <i>triers</i>: the episcopal functions will be usurped or
controlled by the ruthless zeal of an ecclesiastical faction; the
Church societies for the extension of Christian knowledge and
piety will lose their catholic character, dwindling into ignoble
channels for spreading abroad the bigotry of an exclusive school;
and gone for ever will be those beautiful charities, and that
liberal regard to the just exercise of Christian and clerical
freedom, which have been recently elicited, and expressed with
deliberate solemnity, in the correspondence of the Archbishop of
Canterbury and the Bishop of London, with the reverend Canon
Wodehouse, on the subject of subscription.</p>
<p class="pn">The author of this tract has aimed at conciseness,
so far as the nature of the argument would allow, not employing
“those arts by which a big book is made.” But if the smallness of
the work does not seem to accord with the magnitude of the
subject, it is not to be inferred that the sentiments have been
hastily formed or rashly vindicated. For many years they have
been taking deep root in the mind of the writer; nor would he
have engaged in the ministry of the Church, but on the
conviction, after serious inquiry, that her faith was primitive
and not Calvinistic.</p>
<p class="pn">He has spared no “plainness of speech,” in his
exposure of dangerous error, but from principle and feeling he
has abstained from the malice of personal vituperation. His
warfare is with pernicious opinions, not with those who hold
them, many of whom are impressed with the religious persuasion,
that what they have believed they have received from divine
teaching, and that in upholding their creed they glorify God.</p>
<p class="pn">Such divine teaching as the Calvinist claims, and
which, if it means any thing, amounts to plenary inspiration, the
writer does not suppose to have superintended his own thoughts
while engaged in the composition of these pages. He would deem it
unwarrantable presumption to look for such miraculous effusion of
the Spirit in the ordinary condition of the Church. But he
confidently believes, that, to those who seek it in humble faith,
such grace is given as may purify the dispositions of the heart,
and thus guard it from all predilection for error and all
prejudice against <i>the truth</i>. Entertaining these views of
the office of the Holy Spirit under the evangelical dispensation,
the writer humbly commits this work, not executed without
dependence on his preventing grace, to Him who is the eternal
source and the faithful patron of truth; uniting in the prayer of
this beautiful collect, with all those, who, whatsoever their
doctrinal views of religion, seek for truth as the richest of
treasures.</p>
<p class="pn">“O Lord, from whom all good things do come; grant
to us thy humble servants, that by thy holy inspiration, we may
think those things that be good, and by thy merciful guiding may
perform the same, through our Lord Jesus Christ.   Amen.”</p>

PART I.</p>
<p class="pch">GENERAL REMARKS.</p>
<p class="pnn">To St. Augustine, Bishop of Hippo in Africa,
belongs the equivocal distinction of having originated in the
Christian Church a controversy respecting the Divine decrees, a
controversy which dates its origin from the fifth century, and
which, after the lapse of thirteen hundred years, exhibits no
symptoms of approaching to its end. In the Roman Communion, it
was the source of those bitter animosities, which reciprocally
exasperated the Jesuits and Jansenists. The Protestant Churches,
in the early days of the Reformation, were disturbed by the
agitation of this perplexed and perilous subject. And when Calvin
appeared as the vindicator of the Divine sovereignty in
predetermining the fates of men, he only introduced to the
Churches of the Reformation a doctrine which had been transmitted
from earlier times, but which, perhaps, he defined with more
precision, expounded with more fearless consistency, and invested
with the authority of his own great and illustrious name. In the
present discussion the word <i>Calvinism</i> is used, not to
signify those doctrines of the Church which Calvin held in common
with the fathers of the Reformation, but those only which relate
to his extreme views of the Divine decrees, to his predestinarian
theology, and to his modification of other scripture truths to
render them harmonious with his principal tenets.</p>
<p class="pn">Whatever therefore may be the merits or the final
result of this grave and earnest controversy, it leaves untouched
the corruption of human nature, the deity and atonement of
Christ, justification by faith, the necessity of Divine influence
to renew and purify the heart, and the scriptural doctrine of
predestination, according to the fore-knowledge of God. This
distinction is important; since, if it be overlooked, the
rejectors of Calvinism may be supposed to have also rejected the
capital doctrines of the Reformed faith. Fuller has
unwarrantably, perhaps undesignedly, given his sanction to this
imputation in his “Calvinistic and Socinian Systems
compared<sup><a href="#n1" id="f1" title="see footnote" name=
"f1">1</a></sup>.” But the rejectors of <i>Calvinistic</i>
predestination may be not less remote from Socinianism, and much
nearer to genuine Christianity, than the most rigid disciple of
that eminent Reformer, who, in the protestant city of Geneva,
committed Servetus to the flames. The Socinian controversy
relates to doctrines, which are the common faith of the Catholic
Church; with the peculiarities of Calvinism it has no concern.
And it is worthy of remark, that if one class of doctrinalists
more than another symbolizes in any instance with Socinians, the
followers of Calvin form that class; since it is not easy to
discover where lies the essential difference between the doctrine
of <i>philosophical necessity</i>, as held by the greater number
of Socinians, and that of <i>predestination</i>, as maintained by
Calvinists.</p>
<p class="pn">Both parties rest their dogmas on the same
metaphysical grounds. At the same time, as moral reasoners, the
palm of superiority must be awarded to Socinians, who reject most
consistently the doctrine of human corruption, and the atonement
of Christ, together with the correspondent doctrines of the
Gospel, as altogether out of place in a scheme which denies the
freedom of human actions and reduces all independent agency to
that of the Deity alone; while the Calvinist subjects the human
race to an inevitable necessity of sinning, denies to them
individually, even the semblance of a probationary course—makes
them accountable, yet withholds the powers necessary to a moral
agent, and then most unrighteously dooms to perdition all but the
elect! In rejecting such a theory of religion, we reject not the
fundamental doctrines of Christianity; we only vindicate them
from objections, which, if unanswerable, are fatal; and we hold
to the Gospel with a firmer conviction and a livelier faith, when
we behold its accordance with the righteousness of the Divine
administration and with the moral constitution of man.</p>
<p class="pn">On a subject, which has been so long and so
laboriously investigated, and to the illustration of which the
most vigorous and profound of human intellects have directed
their energies, it would be vain to expect any novelty of
argument. On either side, it may be presumed, the question has
been exhausted, or, that the human mind has done all that its
powers can accomplish, however unsatisfactory or inconclusive, in
some respects, the result.</p>
<p class="pn">It appears to the writer of these pages, on a calm
and summary review of the arguments by which the doctrines of
<i>freedom</i> and <i>necessity</i> have been respectively
supported, that those reasonings which are purely
<i>philosophical</i> or <i>metaphysical</i> decidedly
preponderate on the side of N<span class="sc">ecessity</span>.
The prescience of the Deity cannot, <i>on any known
principle</i>, be reconciled with the contingency which attaches
to the actions or determinations of man, on the hypothesis of
freedom<sup><a href="#n2" id="f2" title="see footnote" name=
"f2">2</a></sup>. And, moreover, if every event requires a cause,
and every volition is guided by motives, what are called the
spontaneous acts of the mind must be the necessary result of
motives which direct and command its elections. “To say that in
our choice we reject the stronger motive, and that we choose a
thing merely because we choose it, is sheer nonsense and
absurdity. And whoever, with a sound understanding, will fix his
mind upon the state of the question, will perceive its
impossibility.”</p>
<p class="pn">But, all correct <i>moral</i> reasoning ranges on
the side of <span class="sc">freedom</span>. In opposition to the
subtle or forcible reasonings of the metaphysician, every
individual can plead his inward consciousness of voluntary
agency. He feels, he knows, that he is free. The exercise of the
moral sense, the judgment which the mind pronounces on its own
good or evil movements, the conviction of having done or
neglected a duty, the calm satisfaction of the virtuous mind, and
the fierce or sullen remorse of the criminal, are associated with
the insuppressible persuasion of liberty. Destroy this
persuasion, and virtue is despoiled of its loveliness, vice of
its deformity. But it cannot be destroyed. It is the voice of
nature. The Creator has so formed us, that we cannot throw off
from ourselves the sense of responsibility, nor regard our fellow
creatures as unfit for praise or blame, for love or hatred. Men
treat each other as free agents in all the transactions of human
life, and God administers the government of the world, on the
principle that mankind are capable of self-control, regulating
their conduct by the hope of reward or fear of punishment. If the
consciousness of freedom be a delusion, it follows that moral
obligation, duty, reward, guilt, punishment, are delusions, and
that religion, however salutary in its effects, is nothing better
than a magnificent imposture.</p>
<p class="pn">Calvinism is an attempt to found the religion of
Christ on the doctrine of necessity, and to accommodate its
truths, which suppose and require free agency in man, to a dark
and appalling fatalism. But in a case like the present, in which
metaphysical reasonings, however profound or conclusive, so far
as they go, are at variance with practical truth, with
consciousness, with the actual state of things, and with the
unquestionable procedures of the Divine government, as confirmed
by the scriptures, wisdom would seem to dictate our adhesion to
that side of the question, which is supported by <span class=
"sc">moral</span> arguments.</p>
<p class="pn">In taking this part, it does not follow that we are
to repudiate, as totally without foundation, the philosophy and
the metaphysics of the necessarian—<i>æquo pretio æstimentur</i>.
We may admit, that the force of his argument, in the present
imperfect state of human knowledge, renders the question
perplexed and difficult; that it accounts for the divided
opinions of the erudite and the devout, and that it precludes the
hope of a speedy termination of the controversy. But in assigning
to moral reasoning the superior authority, we are governed by a
just regard to the nature of the question at issue, which, being
related to the destinies of moral agents, and the principles on
which the Deity conducts his moral government, must be
determined, not by metaphysical, but by moral arguments. When
brought to this test, Calvinism appears utterly indefensible, as
being a system at variance with the attributes of the Deity, and
irreconcileable with the moral constitution of human beings, and
with the obligations laid upon them by their Creator. It is
falsified by facts.</p>
<p class="pn">That the predestinarian theology, which denies the
freedom of the will, is supported by names of great
consideration, is cheerfully granted. No man, for example, was
ever endowed with a genius more commanding, with logical powers
more acute, with a faculty more surprising of writing on
recondite subjects with force, perspicuity, and nervous
eloquence, than President Edwards. Nevertheless, the correctness
of his views is not implicitly to be inferred from his
transcendant intellect and fervent piety.</p>
<p class="pn">All the great errors, which have been propagated in
the Christian Church, have found advocates in men of the first
character for intellectual power and moral dignity, or they would
have passed away with their authors into immediate oblivion.</p>
<p class="pn">In estimating the authority of Edwards as a
theologian, it is requisite that we should know the temperament
and habits of that very remarkable person. It is not, perhaps,
generally considered, that great as were the energy and acuteness
of his reasoning powers, he was less under the dominion of these
than of his imagination and feelings. In early life this is not
unfrequently the case with persons of imaginative character; but,
commonly, the ardent enthusiasm of youth gives way afterwards to
the ascendancy of the higher faculties. Edwards was,
constitutionally, too much the creature of dreams and impulses
ever to escape from their control. His gigantic mind was held in
perpetual bondage. His natural temperament was fostered
throughout the whole period which moulds and fixes the character,
by his holding little converse with human beings beyond the
sphere of a particular religious community in an obscure American
town, and by an almost uninterrupted contemplation of nature in
her gloomy and awful forms, amid the silence of uncultivated
plains, and the solitude of interminable forests. The profound
feeling, the intense excitement, which accompanied his early
devotional exercises, were such as to insure a permanent
attachment to every principle and every impression of that
susceptible age. The visions of a warm, and often morbid,
imagination continued to be cherished with religious confidence
and love for ever afterwards. Every doubt, of what he once had
received for truth, was anxiously suppressed in the manhood of
his mind as an infernal suggestion; and the acuteness of his
reasoning powers, by supplying him at all times with an argument,
for what he conceived it <i>his duty</i> to believe, served, not
to emancipate him from false apprehensions of truth, but to rivet
upon him more firmly the chains of ignorance or error. When
argument was doubtful, a dogged fanaticism supplied its place.
This may be illustrated by a particular instance, and bearing
directly on the subject of our present discussion.</p>
<p class="pn">It cannot be doubted, by any person qualified to
appreciate his writings, that his views of the Divine sovereignty
are resolvable into a system of absolute fatalism, so far as the
actions and destinies of men are concerned. Reason and conscience
revolt from the consequences involved in such a system; all our
moral instincts condemn it. But it was instilled into his mind by
Calvinistic instructors in the days of his boyhood; his
imagination was perpetually haunted by it; and having identified
it with the truth of divine revelation, which he held in
religious veneration and awe, he finally vanquished every doubt
respecting it, not by the deliberate exercise of his judgment, on
a calm investigation of evidence, but by the force of his
religious feelings, and of his ascendant imagination. Let him
tell his own story.</p>
<p class="pn">“From my childhood up,” he says, “my mind had been
full of objections against the doctrine of God’s sovereignty, in
choosing whom He would to eternal life, and rejecting whom He
pleased; leaving them eternally to perish, and to be
everlastingly tormented in hell. It used to appear like a
horrible doctrine to me. But I remember the time very well, when
I seemed to be convinced and fully satisfied as to this
sovereignty of God, and his justice in thus eternally disposing
of men, according to his sovereign pleasure. <i>But never could
give any account, how, or by what means I was thus convinced</i>,
not in the least imagining at the time, nor a long time after,
that there was any extraordinary influence of God’s Spirit in it;
but only that now I saw further, and my reason apprehended the
justice and reasonableness of it.” In this extraordinary passage,
the most instructive he ever penned, he confesses, undesignedly
but clearly, that his faith in the Calvinistic theology did not
rest on those arguments by which he has confirmed so many others
in that tremendous creed, but was the result of supposed
supernatural illumination. The true solution would be, “Sit pro
ratione voluntas!”</p>
<p class="pn">Much as we find to admire and revere in this
eminent man, the history of his mind forbids us to rely on him
with implicit confidence as an expositor of divine truth. His
religion was exalted, his genius wonderful, but the subordination
of his judgment to his imagination was an immense evil, producing
an almost superstitious dread of the operations of his own mighty
mind, suppressing its energies, its growth, and its expansion. He
presents an example, not less of the weakness than of the majesty
of human nature. We cease to wonder, when he describes the
happiness of the spirits of the redeemed in heaven, as being
derived, in part, from their listening to the groans and
lamentations of lost souls in hell. Nor can we doubt, that if he
had been born and educated a member of the Church of Rome, he
would have lived and died, like Fenelon or Pascal, a splendid
ornament of that impure communion, a conscientious advocate of
that servile faith.</p>
<p class="pn">Calvinism has never had another advocate equally
qualified with Edwards to vindicate its awful dogmata; and if, by
his own confession, his most potent arguments would have failed
to produce conviction in his own mind, without God’s special
influence, we see reason to suspect the validity of these
arguments, until we have proof that he did indeed receive from
heaven miraculous illumination. Such <i>special influence</i> we
may with propriety question, since a claim to inspiration can be
supported only by the exercise of miraculous powers. Deny,
therefore, the inspiration of this profound writer, of which
there is no proof, and we have his own authority against the
conclusiveness of his own arguments; since he confesses that by
their cogency alone they are insufficient to produce conviction
in opposition to our just and natural conceptions of the
righteous character of God.</p>
<p class="pn">Let us not, therefore, crouch with timid servility
to great names. The opinions of men of erudition, and genius, and
holy zeal for religion, are to be examined with modest deference,
but not to be received with implicit credulity. In the most
enlightened and holy men, who, since the decease of the apostles,
have served God and his Christ; in the fathers of the ancient
Church; in those who headed the Protestant Reformation, and lived
as saints, or died as martyrs; in Luther, Calvin, Cranmer, Knox,
we discover humiliating proofs of imperfection and fallibility.
And, while the fundamental truths of Christianity have been
preserved in the Catholic Church, those truths have been mingled
or associated with errors so injurious and degrading, that no
blind faith is to be rested on any <i>human authority</i>. Let us
uphold the majesty of divine revelation, and vindicate our right
and our duty to interpret the sacred page—not by the traditions
of fallible men, not by the metaphysics of the schools, not by
the “special influences” which an enthusiastic mind may construe
into divine teaching, and which may be pleaded, with equal truth
or falsehood, for every form of error; but by a sober reference
to those moral perfections of the Deity, and to those essential
attributes of human nature, the knowledge of which lies at the
foundation of all sound religious belief. These are to be learned
from the Scriptures, and are the key to their right
interpretation.</p>
<p class="pn">Edwards, incomparably the most able advocate of
Calvinism, since the days of the reformer himself, is not a
solitary example of the way in which a zealous pleader may,
unwarily, betray and weaken his own cause.</p>
<p class="pn">Mr. Scott, in his “<span class="sc">force of
truth</span>,” gives an account of his own conversion to
Calvinism not very dissimilar to that of Edwards, and not in any
degree more honourable to the cause he proposes to defend. The
argument of that work may be summed up in few words. Mr. Scott
entertained a great dislike of Calvinistic doctrines. He rejected
the evidence by which they were supported, as being insufficient
to establish a creed which appeared to him most objectionable.
Yet, strong as were his prejudices against it, they ultimately
gave way, and, <i>therefore</i>, Calvinism must be the truth.
But, in both instances, the impression designed to be made on the
mind of the reader is the same, that is, that the Spirit of God
accomplished what the force of argument had failed to do. Mr.
Scott, therefore, adds his testimony to that of President
Edwards, confessing that Calvinism is not supported by proofs
sufficient in themselves to carry conviction to the human mind,
without special illumination from above; an illumination, which,
assuredly, the <i>religious opposers</i> may as righteously
claim, as the religious defenders of Calvinism. For what
Christian man does not pray for the guidance of God’s good
Spirit? The dispassionate reader of “<i>The Force of Truth</i>,”
will naturally say, that the arguments for the Calvinistic creed
were either sound or unsound. If the former, then Mr. Scott was
either very obtuse or very obstinate to resist so long their
power. If the latter, he acted with great weakness in yielding at
length to insufficient evidence, on the score of an undefinable
impulse. In either case, his name is divested of commanding
authority in the view of reasonable men. Yet it can hardly be
doubted, that this claim to <i>special teaching</i> from the
fountain of wisdom and of truth, has done more, incalculably
more, to awe the minds of men into submission, and thus to obtain
currency for their opinions, than the <i>joint confession</i> of
these popular writers, to the insufficiency of their own
arguments, has availed to render suspected the force of their
reasoning. The impression made on the generality of minds would
be, that men so good, and so candid in confessing their own
obstinacy, could not be mistaken, in believing themselves, at a
subsequent period, to be inspired and infallible<sup><a href=
"#n3" id="f3" title="see footnote" name="f3">3</a></sup>.</p>
<p class="pn">The advocates of Calvinism differ remarkably from
each other in the tone and spirit of their writings, as their
habits of thought and feeling are modified by circumstances. The
American divines of the school of Edwards have carried out his
principles with unflinching consistency, not hesitating to impute
to the Deity, in unqualified terms, the eternal decrees which fix
the weal or woe of the human race for ever. The cold and
heartless manner in which these men treat the subject, and the
stoical apathy with which they contemplate the result of their
hard metaphysics, are extremely remote from our usual conceptions
of piety and humanity. Well might that superlative woman, Mrs.
Susanna Wesley, say, “The doctrine of <i>predestination</i>, as
maintained by rigid Calvinists, is very shocking, and ought
utterly to be abhorred.” The dark spirit of inflexible wrath
which the American Calvinists have imputed to the Deity, together
with their coarse caricatures of the Gospel, may account for, but
cannot justify, the terms in which Dr. Chancing has thought fit
to assail <i>the orthodox faith</i>, confounding on all occasions
scriptural Christianity, as held by the Catholic Church, with the
dogmas of an extravagant creed. To understand his eloquent and
indignant declamations, we must read the transatlantic expounders
of the Calvinistic theology.</p>
<p class="pn">In general, the English writers of any name, are
more guarded and less unfeeling. They do not at once and directly
charge God with being the author of sin. The late Dr. Williams of
Rotherham composed a voluminous work on the subject, entitled
“<span class="sc">equity</span> and <span class=
"sc">sovereignty</span>,” in which he gives, what he considers, a
new theory of the origin of moral evil. To redeem the divine
character from the imputation of harshness in the decree of
reprobation, he supposes mankind under a <i>necessary tendency to
moral defection</i>, as dependent and created beings; and that it
was in mere <i>equity</i>, that the wicked were <i>left</i>, not
decreed, to perdition. The hypothesis of Dr. Williams is already
exploded. It was examined and refuted by the Rev. William Parry,
of Wymondly, in a piece entitled “Strictures on the Origin of
Moral Evil.” For reasoning, acute, profound, and perspicuous,
both metaphysical and moral, this work has seldom been surpassed.
And the devout and courteous spirit in which it is written,
presents an example, beautiful and instructive, of dispassionate
controversy.</p>
<p class="pn">“Upon a review of the argument,” Mr. Parry writes,
“there appear to be strong reasons for considering the whole of
Dr. Williams’ hypothesis, to account for the origin of evil, as
highly objectionable, and worthy of rejection; because it is
founded on a false principle, which identifies physical and moral
tendency; is incompatible with the nature and phenomena of mind;
involves the existence of an antecedent fate or absolute
necessity, which controlled the divine operations; is
inconsistent with the natural and moral perfections of God, and
the scriptural account of the state in which man was created; is
expressed in obscure and inapplicable language; and is so far
from agreeing with <i>equity</i>, that, when taken together, it
represents the Divine Being as having at first, created
intelligent and accountable creatures with such powers as would
enable them to sin, but with none which would enable them to
avoid it.”</p>
<p class="pn">The theory of Dr. Williams found favour with many
Calvinists, because it assumed somewhat of a philosophical
aspect, and was put forth as a clear “<i>demonstration</i>.” But
some of its ablest defenders have since abandoned it to that
oblivion, from which no efforts can save an elaborate
speculation, ungrounded in reason or revelation, and repugnant to
common sense.</p>
<p class="pn">In England the public mind has been so powerfully
and happily influenced by the anti-calvinistic genius of the
liturgy, offices, and discipline of the Anglican Church, that the
grossness and extravagancy of the American divines have been
tolerated chiefly by those who have not fallen under her
instructions, or who have not had the advantage of a liberal
education and extensive reading. In general, whether within or
without the pale of the Church, its more intelligent advocates
have, until lately, exhibited it in a modified form, and thrown
over it a veil of mystery which has hidden its most appalling
deformities from the sight, while by the less skilful or
sagacious only, it has been adapted more to the fears or
affections of women, than to the understandings of men.
Unhappily, the grosser representations of this doctrine are now
coming into repute in quarters where, formerly, they would not
have been endured, and thus afford another warning example of the
“<i>facilis descensus Averni</i>.”</p>
<p class="pn">But under all possible modifications, it is
essentially erroneous; and this small treatise has originated in
no love of discord, or taste for polemic excitement, but in a
solemn sense of duty,—the duty of aiding, in some humble measure,
the more learned and important labours of others who are “set for
the defence of the truth.” The writer aims only at a <i>common
sense</i> view of the subject, showing that Calvinism is a
dangerous speculation, useless for every holy and salutary
purpose, inapplicable to the hopes and the duties of a religious
life, at variance with our knowledge of God, our obligations as
Christians, and all our finer sentiments and more generous
sympathies as men. So far as its influence is exerted, it
contracts the understanding and hardens the heart.</p>
<p class="pn">Bishop Tomline’s “Refutation of Calvinism,” is too
well known and justly appreciated to need recommendation from the
writer of these papers. Faber “on the Primitive Doctrine of
Election,” is an important work, composed with logical precision,
and founded on a laborious analysis of the Scriptures. The
intelligent reader will be instructed and deeply interested by
“An Inquiry into the Doctrines of Necessity and Predestination,”
by Dr. Copleston, the Bishop of Llandaff.</p>
<p class="pn">From the latter work is extracted the following
summary of the peculiar and distinctive doctrines of the
Calvinistic creed, in which it is exhibited, not in a moderated
and qualified form, as it sometimes appears in the writings of
individuals, but in its true and undisguised character, as
maintained by a grave assembly of predestinarian divines.</p>
<p class="pc">CONCLUSIONS OF THE SYNOD OF DOST, AS EXHIBITED BY
TILENUS.</p>
<div style="font-size:92%">
<p class="pch">ART. 1.   OF DIVINE PREDESTINATION.</p>
<p class="pns">That God, by an absolute decree, hath elected to
salvation a very small number of men, without any regard to their
faith or obedience whatsoever; and secluded from saving grace all
the rest of mankind, and appointed them by the same decree to
eternal damnation, without any regard to their infidelity or
impenitency.</p>
<p class="pch">ART. 2.   OF THE MERIT AND EFFECT OF CHRIST’S
DEATH.</p>
<p class="pns">That Jesus Christ hath not suffered death for any
other, but for those elect only; having neither had any intent
nor commandment of his Father to make satisfaction for the sins
of the whole world.</p>
<p class="pch">ART. 3.   OF MAN’S WILL IN THE STATE OF
NATURE.</p>
<p class="pns">That by Adam’s fall, his posterity lost their
free-will, being put to an unavoidable necessity to do or not to
do, whatsoever they do or do not, whether it be good or evil,
being thereunto predestinated by the eternal and effectual secret
decree of God.</p>
<p class="pch">ART. 4.   OF THE MANNER OF CONVERSION.</p>
<p class="pns">That God, to save his elect from the corrupt mass,
doth beget faith in them, by a power equal to that whereby He
created the world and raised up the dead; insomuch, that such
unto whom He gives that grace, cannot reject it, and the rest,
being reprobate, cannot accept it.</p>
<p class="pch">ART. 5.   OF THE CERTAINTY OF PERSEVERANCE.</p>
<p class="pns">That such as have once received that grace by
faith, can never fall from it finally or totally, notwithstanding
the most enormous sins they can commit.</p>

<hr style="width:15%;margin-top:2em;margin-bottom:2em">
<h2 class="ctr"><a name="I" id="I">I.—CALVINISM IMPUGNS THE MORAL
CHARACTER OF THE DEITY.</a></h2>
<p class="pnn">T<span class="sc">he</span> existence of moral
evil is a <i>fact</i>, not to be denied by any man who reverences
his own understanding; and that it seemed fit to the Divine
Wisdom to <i>permit</i> its introduction into the world, is
equally beyond contradiction, unless we limit the divine power,
and suppose that, by a necessity antecedent to the divine will,
and controlling the divine conduct, the Deity himself acts, not
spontaneously but from coercion. That sin, with its awful
consequences, should even exist by <i>permission</i>, under the
administration of infinite benevolence, has been regarded by
theologians as one of the most perplexing mysteries of “the deep
things of God.”</p>
<p class="pn">But Calvinism leads to the direct and inevitable
conclusion, not only that God has permitted the fall of angels
and of men, but that He is himself the original <i>author</i> of
their defection, and of the guilt and suffering which have been
incurred by disobedience. No subtlety of argument, no special
refinements or metaphysical distinctions, no ingenious evasions
can rescue from this fatal conclusion the Calvinistic exposition
of the divine decrees. If the Creator in the construction of the
human mind rendered it naturally, morally, absolutely impossible,
that man should maintain his obedience to the divine law under
the circumstances in which he was placed—the act of
transgression, be it what it may, must be traced to the will and
intention of the Deity—the <i>effect</i>, <span class=
"sc">sin</span>, guilt, condemnation, undefinable misery,
diffused over the face of the creation, and coextensive with the
numberless generations of the family of man—the <i>cause</i>,
G<span class="sc">od</span>; that Being who is perfect reason,
perfect goodness, light without darkness, love without
malevolence; who cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth He
any man; with whom is no variableness neither shadow of turning!
Contrasted with this monstrous compound of impiety and absurdity,
which makes infinite goodness the eternal source of infinite
misery, there is wisdom in the Manichæan doctrine of two
conflicting principles, holding a divided dominion over the
universe, and contending, one for the production of the universal
degradation and wretchedness, the other, for the purity and bliss
of all intellectual and moral beings!</p>
<p class="pn">The advocates of scriptural truth have not failed
to expose, with holy indignation and eloquent remonstrance, the
inconsistency of these views of the divine government with the
entire scope and spirit of the evangelic economy of grace. While
the love of God to a fallen world is the great theme of the
apostolic ministry, and, in language too explicit to be
misunderstood, the propitiation of Christ is said to be for the
sins “of the <i>whole</i> world,”—while, in exact agreement with
the consolatory declaration that God “delighteth not in the death
of a sinner,” the apostles of Christ are commissioned to “preach
the gospel to <i>every creature</i>,”—we are taught by Calvinism,
that the God of truth is only mocking the great mass of his
miserable creatures with a semblance of mercy, from whose
tenderness they are excluded, and with promises and invitations
which He never designed should be accepted by them. A dark and
unrelenting fate has already sealed their destiny, and their
perdition is rendered inevitable before they have committed those
offences for which, as if in derision, they are commanded to
repent, in order that they may escape the wrath of the Almighty.
Thus, in total disregard of all that is holy and majestic in the
character of the Deity, He is described as a Being invested with
the most detestable of Satanic attributes, assuming the gentle
affections of a father, only to exercise more effectually the
wanton power of a tyrant, and treacherously inviting our
confidence and our love, when, with such falsehood and cruelty,
as the most debased of his creatures would not be able to
perpetrate, He is only preparing victims for his inexorable
malice.</p>
<p class="pn">Let it not be said, in opposition to this, that we
are imperfect judges, in any particular case, of the rectitude of
the divine procedures; that our ignorance renders our decision in
such a case daring and presumptuous. We are <i>not</i> ignorant
of what is meant either by <span class="sc">justice</span> or
<span class="sc">mercy</span>. These moral qualities are
essentially the same in nature, whether in created beings or in
their Creator. The only difference is in degree. In the Deity
they are <i>infinite</i>; and, if infinite justice and mercy are
compatible with conduct which, on a smaller scale, would expose a
human being to eternal infamy, then are we disqualified for all
just conceptions of the character of God. If wanton cruelty be
consistent with Divine compassion, then may deception be
reconciled with inviolable faith, and they, who deem themselves
to be happy in the electing love of God, may awake at last to the
fearful discovery, that, having indulged in the dream of special
grace, they are only reserved for a destiny still more terrible
than others, whom they had abandoned as reprobate to the
sovereign wrath of God! By what infatuation are men induced to
rely on any supposed distinctions in favour of themselves, when
they have removed the only grounds of confidence in the righteous
administration of the Deity?</p>
<p class="pn">It is an impressive feature in the works of rigid
predestinarians, that their own minds seem to partake of the
fearful gloom with which they depict the divine attributes. They
appear awed and terror-stricken with the stern aspect of the
great Being whose moral character they have distorted, until they
tremble at the creations of their own imagination. They write as
men whose minds are rendered morbid with mysterious fears, rather
than brightened into holy gladness, by a filial love of God. They
seem to be vindicating with servile dread a character, whose
wrath they would deprecate, and whose doubtful favour they would
propitiate on their own behalf. Even when they express their
persuasion of their own interest in “special grace,” it is more
in the spirit of men who are conscious of being the favoured
objects of capricious tyranny, than of that serene and hopeful
and cheering confidence which inspires the devout heart, when it
contemplates through a happier medium the beneficent and
universal Father. Nor is this unnatural. The moral character of
the Deity, as misrepresented by Calvinism, both unsettles all our
ideas of rectitude, and renders insecure our hold upon Infinite
Goodness.</p>
<p class="pn">That the mental disease of Cowper was intensely
aggravated by depressing views of the divine character, which he
received from Newton and others, and that the consolations which
might have soothed his mind, from a scriptural view of the grace
of the gospel, were neutralised or destroyed by his supposing
himself the victim of an <i>irreversible decree</i>, is clear to
every impartial reader of his most interesting and most
melancholy life. Yet of his piety we have this touching proof,
that, amidst the wildest aberrations of his intellect, and while
oppressed with the conviction that he was numbered with the
reprobate, his persuasion of the rectitude of the divine
government never wavered; he acquiesced in the doom which he
believed to await him; and declared that if it were the will of
God that he should perish, he would not lift a finger to reverse
his fate! Who would not lament, that a mind thus tempered to
pious confidence, should be taught by a pernicious creed to
distrust its own interest in the love of God—a delusion which
passed away only in death!</p>
<hr style="width:13%;margin-top:1.7em; margin-bottom:1.8em">
<h2 class="ctr"><a name="II" id="II">II.—CALVINISM IS NOT TO BE
RECONCILED WITH THE MORAL RESPONSIBILITY OF MAN.</a></h2>
<p class="pn">Whatever extent we assign to the corruption of
human nature, by which its moral powers have been impaired, or
the soul disqualified for the due and proper use of those powers,
it is plain that men are still capable of acting, and of being
treated as the subjects of moral government. Calvinistic writers
do themselves admit the turpitude of sin and the loveliness of
virtue—that vice entails suffering, and that happiness is the
consequence of a religious conformity to the will of God. That
is, setting aside all special refinements by which they attempt
to disprove that the present state of man is probationary, they
confess that <i>practically</i> mankind are treated as
<span class="sc">accountable beings</span> whose guilt is
punished and their goodness rewarded. This broad and
unquestionable fact defies controversy. Although we may not be
able to give a definition of <i>freedom</i> which may satisfy the
philosopher, and although we may concede to the opposers of the
freedom of the will, that virtue and vice—moral good and moral
evil—are to be predicated, not of the cause, whether it be
freedom or fate, from whence our volitions spring, but of the
good or evil nature of the volitions themselves—in whatever way
these questions are decided, or, if we leave them undecided, as
being beyond the present grasp of the human intellect, men are
unquestionably subjected by the Deity to the laws of a moral
economy. They are, sooner or later, rendered happy in exact
proportion to their conformity to the commands of God, and
miserable if they remain rebellious.</p>
<p class="pn">And all we contend for is, that such a state of
things can never be explained on the supposition of absolute
predestination or inevitable necessity, founded on the
irreversible decrees of Heaven. The reason appears on a moment’s
consideration. The good or evil nature of the volition belongs,
on this hypothesis, not to the created being, who is a passive
instrument, without actual power—but to the Creator, who is the
only real agent, as well as the efficient cause. The instrument
by which He accomplishes his purposes may be good or evil, the
volitions of that instrument may be characterised by whatever
qualities you please, still, a mere instrument is not an object
of moral approbation or blame; no responsibility attaches to it,
and the condition on which it acts is perfectly incongruous with
all the ideas we have of reward or punishment. These are
inapplicable to a state of fatalism. The volitions, and the
actions they produce, are in reality those of the Deity. To Him
they belong, and to Him alone. On this critical and decisive
point all the great Calvinistic writers break down. While they
award to human beings the treatment due to moral agents, they
deny to them the attributes without which they cannot be
responsible for their actions.</p>
<p class="pn">To beings under moral government, personal agency
is essential; but Calvinistic fatalism reduces all agency to that
of the Deity alone. The human soul is moved mechanically by
impulse from without, and passively yields to an irresistible
power.</p>
<p class="pn">It supposes the exercise of faculties by which we
are made sensible of our relation to the Deity, and our
obligation to obey his laws. Hence results the consciousness of
rectitude or guilt, and all the noble motives by which we are led
to self-government and self-renunciation—from a sense of duty,
and with a view to future happiness in the enjoyment of the
divine approbation. But Calvinistic necessity destroys the
majesty of the human mind, as “an arbiter enthroned in its own
dominion, endowed with an initiating power, and forming its
determinations for good or for evil by an inherent and
indefeasible prerogative.” It tells us that we have neither power
to act nor freedom to fall—that our sense of liberty is delusive,
that we are predestined to sin or to holiness by a decree of the
infinite mind, and that our fate has been sealed from eternity!
If we really believe it and act upon it, our moral energies are
for ever suppressed, and the consciousness of virtue and of guilt
must give way to the humiliating persuasion that we can do
nothing, and that we have nothing to do, but to yield to our lot
and await our doom, whether to be lost or saved!</p>
<p class="pn">The absurdity of such a theory of religion is a
light consideration compared with the perilous consequences it
must produce, if it were possible that the mass of ignorant and
unreflecting creatures, of which society is composed, should
really believe it true and act in accordance with their belief.
Instructed to regard their present conduct and future allotment,
as being already determined, the notion of a state of
<i>trial</i>, in which they were accountable to God, would be
cast off, with all its salutary restraints upon the passions, and
all its noble incentives to a virtuous life. Nor would it be
possible to enforce the laws of morality by mere temporal
sanctions, the fear of exile, the dungeon, or the gibbet, when
conscience no longer enforced the dictates of religious faith.
The great auxiliary and support of all human authority is to be
found in that most noble attribute of human nature—<i>the sense
of duty</i>, which ceases to operate the moment we lose the
consciousness of freedom, believing that our thoughts, our
actions, <i>ourselves</i>, are but necessary links in an eternal
chain of causes and effects.</p>
<p class="pn">Such a theory of religion renders it absurd to
admonish mankind of their <i>duty</i>, whether to obey the law of
God, or to believe the Gospel of Christ.</p>
<p class="pn">To this reasoning the Calvinist replies: “I
acknowledge that men are morally, spiritually dead. But at the
command of God I would preach to the dead: at his word the dead
shall hear and live.” But this reply is irrelevant to the great
points of the argument. It remains to be proved, that God would
be just in punishing as a crime that spiritual death, of which,
on the Calvinistic theory, He is the author;—that it is possible
for infinite goodness to subject created beings to an inevitable
<i>necessity</i> of breaking his laws, and then hand them over to
perdition. This is the point which cannot be evaded; and it is
fatal to the predestinarian theology. Doubtless God can raise the
dead, literally or spiritually; but that does not touch the
question.</p>
<hr style="width:13%;margin-top:1.7em; margin-bottom:1.8em">
<h2 class="ctr"><a name="III" id="III">III.—CALVINISM IS OPPOSED
TO THE CONSTITUTION AND THE PURPOSES OF A VISIBLE
CHURCH.</a></h2>
<p class="pn">By the visible Church is meant the great body of
persons who are baptized into the faith of Christ, and openly
profess his religion; and the term is used in contradistinction
to the invisible Church, which consists of real, sincere, and
spiritual disciples of our Lord. These may be said to be
invisible, since to search the heart and penetrate its secrets,
is the prerogative of God alone. The truly faithful, as
distinguished from the mere professors of Christianity, will not
be <i>seen</i> in their distinct character until the hour when
the final judgment shall separate the righteous from the wicked.
“<i>Then</i> shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the
kingdom of their Father.”</p>
<p class="pn">The visible Church, with her apostolic ministry,
her worship, her sacraments, and her various provisions for the
edification of the body of Christ, is instituted and constructed
on the manifest principle that the present is a probationary
state, and that those who by her ministrations are brought under
the obligations of the Christian covenant, are not thereby
absolutely but conditionally sealed to eternal life, which is
suspended on their faithful adhesion to Christ, and final
perseverance in his holy ways.</p>
<p class="pn">In exact accordance with this statement, our Lord
describes the kingdom of heaven, or the Christian Church, as a
field in which the <i>wheat</i> and the <i>tares</i> grow up
together until the harvest; and as a net cast into the sea and
gathering of <i>all kinds</i> of fishes, bad and good, which are
afterwards to be separated.</p>
<p class="pn">Not a syllable occurs in the New Testament, not a
single fact transpires in the history of the apostolical
Churches, to justify the persuasion, that such only as were
decreed to eventual salvation, were received as members of the
Christian community. Such an order of fellowship, had it really
existed, would have amounted to a pre-judgment of characters,
anticipating and superseding the judicial sentence of the last
day. In that case, to obtain an entrance into the communion of
the Church was virtually to be proclaimed a member, not only of
the visible, but also of the invisible society of the redeemed,
rendering needless all exhortations to perseverance, and
impossible all danger of apostasy. But such an exclusive and
select and judicial order of fellowship never did and never can
exist under the present dispensation, which is essentially a
mixed state, and one of probation, supplying the means of
<i>working out our own salvation</i>, and of <i>making our
calling and election sure</i>, but not requiring evidence of our
effectual calling and of our certain election to life previous to
our introduction to the worship and sacraments of the Church.</p>
<p class="pn">From the earliest records we have of the
administration of ecclesiastical affairs, as well as from all
later history, we may learn that the Catholic Church never aimed
at the senseless project of a pure communion, which, by excluding
all but the finally elect, should rival in sanctity the
fellowship of the saints above.</p>
<p class="pn">The <i>worship</i> of the Christian Church has
always been open, unrestricted, unconfined by classical
distinctions, such as those of the elect and the reprobate. The
gates of the temple are closed against none who would join in the
celebration of its holy rites. God is the Father of all; Christ
the Saviour of all; the manifestation of the Spirit was given for
the profit of all; the Gospel is to be preached to all. “And the
Spirit and the Bride say, Come, and let him that heareth say,
Come, and let him that is athirst come. And whosoever will, let
him take the water of life freely.”</p>
<p class="pn">The same free and charitable principle has directed
the administration of the <i>sacraments</i>, a circumstance the
more remarkable, since, in the judgment of the most eminent
Fathers of the Church, these are the channels by which spiritual
grace is actually communicated to all who are rightfully
baptized, and religiously partake of the Lord’s supper. The
formularies of our own branch of Christ’s Catholic Church are so
clear and definite on this point, that every effort of ingenious
casuistry to give them another meaning, or to reconcile their use
with the Calvinistic theology, has ended in discomfiture. The
<i>sacraments</i> are “outward and visible signs of an inward and
<span class="sc">spiritual grace</span>, given unto us, ordained
by Christ himself, as a <i>means</i> whereby we receive the same,
and a <i>pledge</i> to assure us thereof.” This <i>grace</i> is
imparted, not as to the elect and to them exclusively, but as to
beings who are free and responsible, who have to account for
their use of this sacred and inestimable gift, and who may
forfeit its blessings by subsequent guilt and final impenitence.
The present state of our knowledge, or rather ignorance of the
philosophy of the human mind, may not supply us with a
satisfactory answer for those, who, in a cavilling or sceptical
spirit, ask, “How can these things be?” But it is the doctrine of
the Scriptures and of the Church, and it is perplexed with fewer
difficulties than will be found to press upon every other
hypothesis.</p>
<p class="pn">Supposing the Calvinistic doctrine of
predestination to be founded in truth, the very existence of the
visible Church in its present form is a mystery which requires to
be solved. No part of its constitution or order harmonises with a
scheme based on fatalism, and limiting the grace of Heaven to a
narrow section of the human family.</p>
<p class="pn">The Sabbath bell, joyously or solemnly, invites all
who hear to come to the house of God; and in the name of the
“great congregation” the minister of Christ addresses the Deity,
saying, “<i>Our</i> Father which art in heaven!”</p>
<p class="pn">But Calvinism pronounces that God is <i>not</i>
“the lovely Father of all mankind;” and, that while He has
instituted the rites of religious worship, and invites all to
mingle in its sacred duties, He regards the greater number as
“<i>cursed children</i>,” marked out for perdition, “<i>before
the morning stars sang together, or ever the sons of God shouted
for joy</i>.”</p>
<p class="pn">The ministers of the Church administer to all adult
converts from paganism, Judaism, or Mahometanism, who make a
credible profession, and to all infants, whose sureties engage
for their Christian education, the rite of baptism, signifying
the remission of past sin, original or actual, and pledging the
communication of whatever grace is needful to remedy or assist
the weakness of nature in the moral warfare with temptation.</p>
<p class="pn">But Calvinism not only abjures this indiscriminate
bestowment of grace; but denies that even the elect are
regenerated in baptism, leaving it to the arbitrary determination
of God’s decree, at what given period, and under what
circumstances, they shall be, instantaneously, and without regard
to any foregoing state of mind or habits of life, transformed
into the beloved, and loving, and lovely children of
God<sup><a href="#n4" id="f4" title="see footnote" name=
"f4">4</a></sup>!</p>
<p class="pn">In a word, Calvinism supposes and requires an order
of administration totally distinct from that which actually
exists in the visible Church of God. And, accordingly, various
Calvinistic communions, which have separated from the Church
since the Reformation, have attempted a literal “fellowship of
<i>saints</i>,” presuming to discriminate from the mass of
nominal Christians those who have experienced the conclusive and
saving change of Calvinistic conversion, and admitting such only
to the full enjoyment of Church privileges and to the Lord’s
table. It seems not a little surprising, that not only sagacious
individuals but extensive communities should persevere in an
attempt which, in the nature of things, can lead only to
disappointment; for, the sincerity of that species of conversion
which is supposed to be final, of that grace which is said to be
irrevocable, can never be decided until the Judge of all has
pronounced his verdict. In the meantime, the terms of communion
<i>must</i> agree in some measure with the actual state of man;
and when the matter is quietly examined, it appears that even in
Calvinistic communions the terms of membership are reduced to a
profession of the received “faith and order,” and an assurance,
on the part of the initiated, that he believes himself to be a
converted person by God’s special grace. This is all that is
required besides evidence of good moral character; more than this
is impracticable. The spirit of Calvinism can never be fully
embodied in a system of Ecclesiastical polity corresponding
exactly with its own nature, and marked by its own exclusiveness;
for who shall discern the elect?</p>
<p class="pn">This discovery appears to have been made by an
eminent Calvinistic clergyman of the present day, who, instead of
coming to the legitimate conclusion that Calvinism is therefore
untenable, as being an impracticable system, has recourse to a
delusive theory of ecclesiastical fellowship, which confounds the
visible with the invisible Church, or reduces the former to a
mere nullity. According to <i>his</i> view of the subject, the
Church of Christ consists, not of the collective body of persons
who may happen to be in fellowship with any particular Christian
communities, nor of the aggregate of persons who throughout the
world make an outward profession of our holy faith, but of those,
and those only, who “maintain the doctrines of grace, and uphold
the authority of Christ in the world,” with whatever denomination
of Christians they are in external fellowship. These, being the
truly regenerate, are to tolerate each other’s differences on
minor questions, to love each other as being one in Christ, and
to co-operate in every way for the diffusion of their common
principles throughout the world. Mr. Noel’s theory confirms the
statement made in this section, that Calvinism, which it is
presumed he means by “the doctrines of grace,” denies the claim
of any <i>mixed body</i> of professing Christians, such as the
Anglican, or the Lutheran, or the Scottish, or any other church,
in its aggregate character, to be <i>a church</i>, or a distinct
branch of the Catholic Church. That is, Calvinism is opposed to
the constitution and the purposes of a visible church. Mr. Noel’s
theory is fatal to its existence. For, when it is said of those
exclusively, who, in whatever denomination, “maintain the
doctrines of grace,”—“<i>and this one body is</i> <span class=
"sc">the church</span>,”—it is clearly proveable, that these
persons have no intelligible grounds on which to rest that high
and exclusive pretension; <i>they are not</i> <span class=
"sc">the visible church</span>.</p>
<p class="pn">These persons may, or may not, be members of the
spiritual or <i>invisible</i> Church; <i>that</i> is known only
to the Searcher of the heart. They may or may not be the most
holy and sincere individuals in the several churches or
denominations with which they hold external communion;
<i>that</i> also remains to be confirmed or refuted by “the final
sentence and unalterable doom.” But they do not constitute what
is commonly understood by the visible Church of God. They have no
ministry, no worship, no administration of the sacraments,
visibly distinct from the mass of persons who are of the same
external fellowship with themselves; and the error of assigning
to them the distinction of being alone the true Church arises
from the ambiguity of the word <i>Church</i>, on which changes
are rung, producing a confusion of ideas—a double confusion of
ideas, “confusion worse confounded.” What is the mental process
by which Mr. Noel arrives at this point? <i>First</i>, the
invisible Church is tacitly put and mistaken for the visible, the
truly spiritual for the nominal, it being assumed that we can
know the hearts of others. Then, <i>secondly</i>, this invisible
Church is supposed to become visible, and to be <i>alone</i>
visible, in the persons of those who maintain the doctrines of
grace; while the really external Church, consisting of the entire
body of professing Christians throughout the world, vanishes out
of sight, and is declared to have no ecclesiastical existence!
The truth is, that Calvinism and a visible Church are incongruous
ideas, and that no man, of whatever talent he may be possessed,
can make them harmonize. The Calvinist believes, and is
consistent in his belief, that the elect only are “the Church,”
but since it is impossible to discriminate them from others, it
is impossible to unite them in an exclusive visible fellowship.
And, if it were possible, they would form such a Church as never
before existed. Calvinism is irreconcileable with the order which
has descended from the apostolic age, by the consent of the
Catholic Church, and with any visible constitution.</p>
<p class="pn">If Mr. Noel has succeeded in making converts to
<i>his</i> theory of a visible Church, from the difficulty they
find in detecting its fallacies, it only proves, that</p>
<p class="pch">“Sheer no-meaning puzzles more than wit.”</p>
<p>The dissenter who, on objecting to a Church rate, said, that
“If all Churchmen were like Mr. Noel, neither he nor his brethren
would object to join them,” does not seem to have been aware that
they were already members of Mr. Noel’s Church. Or, what is more
probable, it was designed significantly to hint to that reverend
gentleman, that he was no more attached than themselves to the
Church of which he is a pastor, and whose ordination vows are
upon him,—and that with Churchmen who are prepared so to betray
or deny their Church, under an erroneous sense of duty,
dissenters may without difficulty form an alliance<sup><a href=

<h2 class="p0"><a name="IV" id="IV">IV.—CALVINISM IS PRODUCTIVE
OF POSITIVELY INJURIOUS EFFECTS ON INDIVIDUAL CHARACTER, AND ON
SOCIAL HAPPINESS.</a></h2>
<p class="pnn">W<span class="sc">hen</span> Lord Chatham taunted
the Church with having “a Calvinistic creed, a popish liturgy,
and an Arminian clergy,” that illustrious person was the author
of a libel on this holy and apostolical institution. Her creed is
not Calvinistic, for it says nothing about absolute
predestination; her liturgy it not popish, for there is no
worship of saints or of the Virgin; her clergy are not Arminian,
for their moderation has preserved them, as a body, from all
extremes in doctrine, and <i>that</i>, as well as their
unrivalled erudition and intellectual power, has been the
admiration of the most eminent protestant divines and men of
letters in Europe. And to her truly scriptural character,
especially her rejection of the Calvinistic theology, with its
gloomy, turbulent, and intolerant spirit, may be traced the high
tone of moral feeling and practical reverence of religion which
have honourably distinguished the people of England. Happily,
Calvinism in its palmy days was confined to the Puritanical
party, which made comparatively small progress within the pale of
the Church; while the most influential of her clergy, and the
great majority of her well educated laity, embraced the doctrines
of a more generous and scriptural theology. Without falling into
Pelagianism, a charge made by Calvinists on all who reject the
system improperly called “the doctrines of grace,” they held the
great evangelic truth that Christ “<i>died for all</i>,” and its
correspondent views of the benevolence of God, and the moral
dignity of human nature, impaired, but not destroyed, by the
fall.</p>
<p class="pn">The principles of the remonstrants, without being
servilely embraced, influenced and modified the religious
opinions of the people of England, who were never generally
favourable, either to the dogmas or the discipline of the Genevan
reformer, and to this circumstance are we largely indebted for
the manly and the moral character of our country.</p>
<p class="pn">This statement, founded on the history of the
Reformation and the times which followed, is not intended as an
indiscriminate attack on the moral character of Calvinists. Many
of them are to be classed with the holiest of men; not because
they are Calvinists, but because their erroneous notions are
rendered innoxious, by the prevalence of a sincere piety, and by
a secret and practical disbelief of the principles which, in
speculation or imagination, they seem to hold.</p>
<p class="pn">It would be both unjust and uncharitable to judge
any class of persons simply by the creed they subscribe, or to
impute to them the consequences which might be supposed to follow
from a rigid adherence to its doctrines. There are antagonist
principles at work; there is the law written on the heart; there
is grace to counteract the tendency of false impressions; there
is the love of God and of man to render those who are truly good
men superior to any bad principles they have unhappily imbibed.
Their Christianity is dominant, and their Calvinism is made
harmless.</p>
<p class="pn">But evil speculation has a tendency in all minds to
lessen or destroy the power of those dictates of conscience which
are honourable to us as moral agents; and it will counteract, so
far as it goes, the salutary influence of those scriptural truths
which still retain their hold upon the judgment or the feelings.
In but few instances, comparatively, can Calvinism be altogether
harmless; in the ordinary course of things, it is productive of
results positively injurious.</p>
<p class="pn">In persons of serious religion, it will produce
opposite effects, as they may be gentle and timid, or bold and
presumptuous. In the former, anxiety, fearful apprehension, deep
distress, approaching to despondency, lest the tremendous decree
of reprobation should have been recorded against them in the
indelible page. In the latter, who can bring a sanguine
temperament of mind to the contemplation of the subject, the
effect may be, and often is, unbounded confidence, leading to
self-complacency and spiritual pride; the very natural result of
believing that they are special objects of the love of God, and
that their persuasion is a divine impulse, God speaking to the
heart. Spiritual pride may assume the aspect of profound
humility, and thus impose on its victim by the notion that he is
only magnifying the sovereign grace of Heaven in his election to
eternal life. But such is the weakness of human nature, that the
consciousness of this high distinction needs to be chastened by
very lofty views of the moral virtue required by Christianity,
and by very humbling conceptions of our own, to prevent a false
and dangerous elation of the heart.</p>
<p class="pn">And, in how many instances this consciousness is
mere delusion, it would seem almost needless to suggest. It is
often professed under suspicious circumstances by doubtful
characters. Nothing can be more groundless than the persuasion so
commonly entertained by persons of this creed, that to be fully
convinced of the truth of the doctrine is a sufficient ground of
confidence that <i>they</i> are therefore of the number of the
chosen people. The strongest conviction may be deceptive. The
firmest assurance may be the result of ignorant or fanatical
presumption. And whatever may be the readiness of this class of
persons to say, “My mountain standeth firm—I shall never be
moved,” it cannot but be feared respecting many of them, that
they have yet to learn the very “first principles of the oracles
of God.” The remarkable absence of humility and charity in these
“children of special grace” is alone enough to render their
Christianity questionable, exposes the dangerous nature of their
delusion, and proves the practical inutility of their scheme;
since, after all, without the evidence of a truly evangelical
temper and life, no inward assurance would satisfy a reflecting
mind; and in the possession of such evidence, no other assurance
is needed.</p>
<p class="pn">The self-righteousness of the Pharisee is scarcely
more to be dreaded than the spiritual pride of the Calvinist,
when it has passed from under the control of holy wisdom. It
assumes the character of selfishness, bigotry, and the lust of
intolerant dominion.</p>
<p class="pn">The same spirit of exclusiveness and domination,
which pervades in general their ecclesiastical polity, affects
their allegiance to the state. Under cover of abolishing
episcopacy, the doctrinal Puritans were the principal authors of
that revolution which introduced the Commonwealth after the fall
of the monarchy; and their aim was the exclusive <i>dominion of
the saints</i>, that by political power they might establish
their own forms of Church government. Religion was really their
object, and they were not hypocritical in professing it; but to
accomplish their spiritual projects, they considered themselves
entitled to secular dominion; and their tyranny in Church and
State was so overbearing, that the nation, after the death of
Cromwell, eagerly threw itself into the arms of the Stuarts,
almost without a compact, rather than endure the sanctimonious
intolerance of Calvinistic patriots and republican
saints<sup><a href="#n6" id="f6" title="see footnote" name=
"f6">6</a></sup>.</p>
<p class="pn">The same leaven is still at work. The doctrinal
Puritans of the present day have the same lordly consciousness of
a right to dominion. They have declared their resolution to
“stagger senates, and smash cabinets” until their points are
carried. They have given to the nation a significant announcement
of their claims to power, by their politico-religious synod of
Manchester. The imperial parliament of these realms is, in
future, it seems, to make its fiscal arrangements, and legislate
on points of purely political economy, under the dictation of the
Calvinistic divines of the nineteenth century<sup><a href="#n7"
id="f7" title="see footnote" name="f7">7</a></sup>. Doubtless,
our future Chancellors of the Exchequer will be selected from
this body of sacred financiers.</p>
<p class="pn">While it produces effects so remote from those of
true Christianity in the <i>religious</i> professors of
Calvinism, on the mass of ignorant, sordid, unreflecting, and
worldly-minded persons, who are taught these doctrines, its worst
influences are seen to operate; and, as the country was
notoriously demoralized at the close of the Cromwellian
dictatorship, when Calvinistic divines had enjoyed a long and
signal triumph, so is the present age marked by a degeneracy in
the public morals, which has kept pace with the progress of
opinions of similar character and tendency. The rude multitude is
taught that there is no grace but <i>special</i> grace, and this
produces recklessness and indifference, since no efforts will
avail if they are not to be partakers of these, to them,
forbidden streams of the river of the water of life. Or, perhaps,
this gloomy doctrine produces a sullen suspicion, vague and
undefined, of the rectitude of God, and thus alienates still more
those hearts which are already adverse to the Divine
government.</p>
<p class="pn">Of all the mischievous extravagances of opinion,
none has produced more fatal consequences, than the notion, that
God takes particular delight in selecting the vilest of men for
the object of his electing love; and that the gross sinner is
better prepared for the grace of Christ, than they who have
walked in the paths of virtue.</p>
<p class="pn">It is a melancholy but instructive fact, that in
Calvinistic families, the puritanical order and discipline which
are often highly commendable, have proved insufficient to
counteract the malignant effects of the doctrines inculcated on
the minds of the young. Instead of being taught that grace is
given to all, and that all are responsible for its use, they are
instructed that this blessing may perhaps be withholden. And no
families have sent forth into the world more affecting examples
of worthless and unprincipled young men, who have brought down
the grey hairs of their excellent but mistaken parents with
sorrow to the grave!</p>
<p class="pn">If the unguarded preaching of “the doctrines of
grace,” and the scanty instruction given on the great duties of
practical religion, have contributed to the demoralized state of
the people, let it not be supposed that other causes have been
wanting to swell the tide of corruption. From the Revolution,
toleration has been gradually enlarged, until all salutary
restraints have been swept away, and the glorious liberties of
our country have degenerated, by a fatal abuse, into unbridled
licentiousness. The press is daily infusing poison into the
public mind. What once would have been punished as
<i>profaneness</i> and <i>blasphemy</i>, is no longer noticed by
the gentle guardians of the law, and <i>treason</i> has almost
ceased to be a crime. Liberalism has trampled over law, and the
reigning evils have been unhappily aggravated by those whose
position in the state ought to have dictated other conduct than
that of making anarchical principles the road to dominion.</p>
<hr style="width:13%;margin-top:1.7em; margin-bottom:1.8em">
<h2 class="ctr"><a name="V" id="V">V.—CALVINISM IS NOT THE
DOCTRINE OF SCRIPTURE OR OF THE ANGLICAN CHURCH.</a></h2>
<p class="pn">The general tenor of the Holy Scriptures is so
clearly against it, that it is impossible to account for the
facts or the doctrines of the Bible on supposition of the truth
of the Calvinistic theology: Nor would it be needful to discuss
the subject, however briefly, on scriptural grounds, but for a
few particular texts which are cited against the current
testimony of the word of God. It is said that <i>one</i> text, if
plain and direct, is evidence enough for the establishment of any
doctrine. This may be a sound canon of interpretation, where the
one text admits but one meaning, and that meaning is not opposed
by conflicting evidence, but not otherwise. In the present
instance, there exists, in addition to the opposing stream of
Scripture testimony, the following strong presumption against the
Calvinistic view of particular texts. Supposing the doctrine of
Calvinistic fatalism to be correct, no explanation can be given
of the general tenor of Divine revelation, none which <i>can</i>
be made to harmonize with that doctrine. The entire history of
<span class="sc">providence</span> and <span class=
"sc">redemption</span>, as given in the Bible, proceeds on the
principle, not of fate, but of freedom; and if we are not free,
we are reduced to the suspicious and unworthy conclusion, that
the secret and the revealed will of God are at variance with each
other; that we are deceived by a scheme of things designedly
arranged to convey false impressions of truth, and that while God
treats us now as though we were accountable beings, He fixes our
final destinies without any regard whatsoever to our imaginary
freedom and pretended responsibility.</p>
<p class="pn">On the other hand, taking the general tenor of the
sacred volume to be the true representation of the moral economy
under which we are placed by the infinite wisdom of God, all the
passages which are cited by Calvinists, as being favourable to
their cause, may be so explained, and that without violence, as
to accord with the current testimony of the Scriptures to the
freedom and moral agency of man. A stronger presumptive argument
cannot be conceived against the claim of Calvinism to scriptural
authority.</p>
<p class="pn">Let it be also distinctly observed, that the cause
of Calvinism is not served by those passages of Scripture which
relate to the election of individuals, or of nations, to certain
privileges which do not extend to the absolute enjoyment of
eternal life. Of this description is the ninth of the Romans. The
subject of that celebrated chapter is not the election of
individuals to final salvation, but the election of the Jews to
the honor of being the visible Church, and their subsequent
rejection through open unbelief. Nor does the allusion contained
in it to the destruction of Pharaoh and his host in the Red sea,
yield an argument in favour of Calvinistic reprobation. The fact
that the infatuated monarch was hardened in heart by <i>the
leniency</i> which spared him under so many provocations and
insults offered by him to the Almighty God, does not prove, nor
was it designed to prove, that he was the fated victim of an
eternal decree, whether in regard to his secular or spiritual
condition.</p>
<p class="pn">Nor can Calvinism plead for itself those texts
which are supposed to refer to the election of individuals to
final salvation, but which at the same time leave unsettled the
important question at issue; whether that election was absolute
and irrespective of character, or whether it was founded on the
foreknowledge of their faith and obedience. Such for example is
the language of St. Paul, 2 Thess. ii. 13, 14. All such passages
leave the controversy undetermined, proving only that the
doctrine of election is scriptural, but not fixing the sense in
which it is to be taken, whether absolute or conditional.</p>
<p class="pn">The terms <i>election</i> and
<i>predestination</i>, with their correlates, are of frequent
occurrence in the New Testament, and with various significations,
which are to be explained by the particular subjects to which
they refer. But the <i>only</i> texts which really bear on the
Calvinistic controversy, are those which may seem to represent
election as sovereign, arbitrary, and totally irrespective of the
faith and obedience of the elect; such are few indeed. Let us
review <i>that</i> which is deemed by the advocates of Calvinism
among their most conclusive evidences. “That election,” says
Edwards, “is not from a foresight of works, as depending on the
condition of man’s will, is evident by 2 Tim. i. 9. ‘Who hath
saved us, and called us with an holy calling, <i>not according to
our works</i>, but according to his own purpose and grace, which
was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began.’ ” Edwards
was not more remarkable for acuteness and subtlety as a reasoner,
than for his lax and indiscriminate citations of Scripture. He
appeals to this text with such confidence, that he deems no
analysis to be necessary. The bare citation is enough.</p>
<p class="pn">But a brief examination of the passage will make it
clear that it yields no support to Calvinism. The Calvinist
affirms “that God, by an absolute decree, hath elected to
salvation a very small number of men without any regard to their
faith and obedience whatsoever.” That is, the decree which
insures the safety of the elect is not founded on God’s
foreknowledge of their holiness and of their perseverance in the
faith. To show that this doctrine is supported by the passage
under our consideration, it must be proved, that when the Apostle
says, “not according to <i>our works</i>,” he means our
<i>Christian</i> good works, our faith, our repentance, our
charity, our evangelic obedience to Christ; of this, there is not
the shadow of evidence. On the contrary, the <i>works</i> alluded
to are those, whether good or bad, which were done in a state of
heathen or Jewish depravity, at any rate done before believers
exercised faith and repentance, and were called to the privileges
of the Christian Church. No other interpretation will hold.</p>
<p class="pn">St. Paul states that God “hath saved us, and called
us with an holy calling.” He then proceeds to trace this happy
condition to its sources. He begins with a negation. The
antecedent cause of our salvation and calling was <i>not our
works</i>; we were not treated <i>according to</i> our works; not
after the measure, the proportion, the merit or demerit of our
works: these might have brought punishment, but could never have
procured for us blessings so great and undeserved. The real cause
was <i>the purpose of God</i> and <i>his grace</i> given in
Christ before the world began.</p>
<p class="pn">Here, <i>our works</i> are put in distinct
opposition to the purpose and grace of God.</p>
<p class="pn">They could not, therefore, be our Christian works,
done in a state of salvation and subsequent to our obeying the
holy calling. <i>These</i> are the practical results, the
<i>moral effects</i>, of our holy calling according to the
gracious purpose of God. These could never have been done but for
that holy calling. They could not therefore in any sense be the
<i>antecedent cause</i> of that holy calling. In the order both
of nature and of time, both the gracious purpose and the holy
calling must have preceded these works. To tell any man of common
sense, that they were not the procuring cause of the grace from
whence they were themselves derived, was needless.</p>
<p class="pn">To one so intelligent as Timothy, such instruction
was worse than superfluous. Works could not hold the twofold
relation of cause and effect to God’s grace. Nor can it be
supposed that St. Paul was the author of a solecism so obvious,
as that of formally setting in opposition to the <i>purpose</i>
and the <i>grace</i> of God those evangelic works, which were the
moral effects of the influence of that grace and of the execution
of that purpose. The works alluded to were those which might be
done before men were partakers of the Christian salvation, or
independently of the dispensation of grace, and according to
<i>such</i> works no man could be entitled to the blessings of
eternal redemption.</p>
<p class="pn">This important text lends no support to the
Calvinist. It cannot be cited in proof, that the election of God
is arbitrary and uninfluenced by his foreknowledge of the faith
and obedience of his chosen people, for the works here intended
are <i>not Christian good works</i> done in faith. Edwards did
wisely in not analyzing this text.</p>
<p class="pn">The same principle of interpretation is applicable
to Titus iii. 5. “<i>Not by works of righteousness</i> which we
have done, but according to his mercy he saved us by the washing
of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost.” These
<i>works</i> are not those of the truly regenerate, which being
the <i>effects</i> of the grace of Christ, cannot be mistaken for
the meritorious cause of the communication of that grace. It is
rather to be taken as a broad assertion, that the blessings of
the Christian covenant, are not the result or the reward of human
deserts; that apart from the redemption of Christ, there are
<i>no</i> works of righteousness by which we can be saved; and
that while Christians are made really holy and good, their
sanctification is to be traced to the grace of God in Christ
Jesus. In neither passage is there any statement on which to rest
an argument for the arbitrary and unconditional decree of the
Calvinist, nor for depreciating the intrinsic value of those
really good works which the Christian performs in faith.
Calvinism has no foundation in the word of God. It is in direct
collision with that sacred authority. St. Paul rests the divine
election on the <span class="sc">foreknowledge</span> of the
Deity, and let his decision be final. “Whom he did
<i>foreknow</i>, he also did predestinate, to be conformed to the
image of his Son.”</p>
<p class="pn">The seventeenth Article of the Church accords with
the Scriptures, and its doctrinal statements are made almost
entirely in the language of the sacred writers, and of those
eminent divines of the Reformation who abjured Calvinism and
adhered to the Bible. It is drawn up with great moderation, says
nothing of absolute decrees and unconditional election, and it
treats the subject practically. The concluding paragraph relating
to “curious and carnal persons” shows that the venerable
compilers of the Article rejected extreme views of this doctrine,
since these only could lead to “a most dangerous downfall.” But
if the article itself be at all equivocal, it must be interpreted
by the formularies of the Church and by the Scriptures, since no
dogma is to be imputed to this holy branch of Christ’s Catholic
Church, that is at variance with the attributes of God, the moral
constitution of man, the testimony of the Bible, and the
obligations of practical religion.</p>
<p class="pn">If Calvinism be the doctrine of our Church, then
are the <i>Catechism</i>, and the Order for the Ministration of
<i>Baptism</i>, the most absurd and delusive compositions by
which the minds of men were ever led astray.</p>

<h2 class="p0"><a name="VI" id="VI">VI.—CALVINISM HAS LED TO THE
CORRUPTION OF CHRISTIAN DOCTRINE, THAT THE SCRIPTURES MAY BE

<p class="pn">It was not in the nature of things, that
Calvinistic predestination should be received as truth, without
producing such a modification of the entire system of divine
revelation, as would impress on it a new and completely different
character. Christianity, in its unadulterated simplicity, is
distinguished by the consolatory views it imparts of the
benignity and grace of God, and by the direct and cogent motives
it suggests for holiness and righteousness of life. But the first
article of the Calvinistic creed throws a veil of awful and
suspicious mystery over the divine goodness, and represents it
“as the sun shorn of his beams.” Having determined that God is
not the universal Father, nor “the Saviour of all men,” but the
projector of a scheme which predetermines the ruin of the great
mass of his creatures, Calvinism models to its own purpose all
those doctrines of Christianity which are in beautiful accordance
with the truth that “G<span class="sc">od is love</span>.” It
denies that the atonement of Christ was intended to make
satisfaction for “the sins of the <i>whole</i> world.” It
announces that the non-elect are laid under an irresistible
necessity of sinning to destruction, and that no spiritual grace
is imparted to rescue them from the dominion of native,
incurable, uncontrolled depravity.</p>
<p class="pn">The gracious invitations and promises of the Gospel
are reduced to unmeaning terms, so far as the many are concerned.
And while Calvinism is denominated by its admirers “the doctrines
of grace,” it obliterates from the Scriptures every trace of
sincere mercy, and robs the diadem of heaven of its purest and
brightest gem. <i>Calvinism</i> and <i>grace</i> are
heterogeneous terms, representing discordant ideas.</p>
<p class="pn">The motives to a holy life, governed by piety and
adorned with virtue, must be impaired by the views here given of
the Deity. No human mind can be habituated to the contemplation
of the divine conduct, as it is seen distorted by the
predestinarian theology, and retain its just sentiments of what
is right, what is just, what is honourable, what is lovely in
goodness. The man who imitates the God of the Calvinist, that
phantasm of a morbid or dreaming imagination, cannot fail to have
his moral sentiments corrupted, and to become deceptive,
shuffling, treacherous, and eventually insensible to the misery
of others.</p>
<p class="pn">The Calvinistic doctrines of <i>regeneration</i>
and <i>perseverance</i> are not calculated to rectify these
evils. These are made to harmonize with the fatalism which bears
all men along with irresistible energy, the reprobate to
perdition, the redeemed to blessedness. The new birth is
described as a sudden transformation of our spiritual nature,
effected by sovereign grace, unconnected with the preceding
states of the mind, whether good or evil, and attended with the
communication of spiritual life which can never afterwards be
forfeited or lost. No sins, however enormous, can endanger the
elect, although they may for a time cloud their evidences. The
effects produced by this doctrine on the mind of that individual
who believes himself to be thus specially distinguished, must be
of a very dangerous kind, unless counteracted as it frequently is
by other principles, or restrained by the genuine spirit of
Christianity operating with antagonist energy.</p>
<p class="pn">It is this <i>necessary</i> corruption of the great
truths of the Gospel that renders Calvinism an object of distrust
and alarm. If it was a mere speculation, which was intended, in
the calm spirit of Christian philosophy, to solve a problem in
theology or morals, leaving untouched the essential character of
revealed religion, it might pass without rebuke. But it weakens
the moral sense, and it leads to the subversion of all that is
consolatory in our prospects of the final destinies of the human
race, leaving us no security for the salvation even of the
supposed elect; for what hope can repose with confidence on the
supreme Arbiter of events, when He is believed to be the author
of a religion which represents Him as acting without any
intelligible moral motive, destroying the majority of the human
race for offences not their own, and saving the remnant without
regard to their Christian virtues!</p>
<p class="pn">It is remarkable that, while in modern times many
disavow their belief in those views of the <i>divine decrees</i>
which form the basis of the Calvinistic creed, and which have
occasioned this corruption of Christian truth, they still hold to
these corruptions, and write and preach on the implied principle
that the grace of God is limited by decree to those whom they
specially designate his children. They have been driven from the
foundation, and still they cleave to the superstructure. They
assume the designation of <i>moderate</i> Calvinists, not
perceiving that the doctrines of particular redemption, and
special grace, and exclusive assumption of a filial relation to
God, are untenable when absolute predestination is exploded.
Calvinism, after all, is their creed, since the system to which
they adhere cannot rest on any other foundation.</p>
<p class="pn">It is to be inferred, therefore, that for persons
of a certain temperament this doctrine has charms so powerful as
to negative the calm dictates of the judgment, and practically to
render the mind insensible to the force of truth.</p>
<p class="pn">And what are its recommendations to those who
embrace it?</p>
<p class="pn">1. Calvinism is both exciting and sedative,
exciting to the imagination, and sedative to the conscience. Thus
it is accommodated to two of the leading principles of human
nature, the love of the awful, the terrific, the deeply tragic,
and the natural anxiety which all men feel, to be rid of the
consciousness of guilt and of personal danger. Nothing can exceed
the tremendous scenes opened to the imagination by that system of
theology, which dooms to perdition the great mass of human
beings, who are permitted by their Creator to sport or suffer
upon earth through a few rapid revolutions of time, and are then
swept away for ever into an abyss of ruin; while, with
confounding and dreadful mystery, the Author of their being is
represented as the great agent in this work of appalling
desolation. To redeem his character for mercy, He rescues an
elect few, but leaves the devoted multitude without pity and
without hope, to everlasting torment. Whether we contemplate this
fearful character of the Deity, or endeavour to realize the
scenes which await the departure of lost souls, or attempt in
imagination to identify ourselves with the happy spirits of the
redeemed, who have escaped, <i>they know not why</i>, the general
destruction of all that is dear to man, we must be sensible that
all the ordinary conceptions of the human mind are comparatively
powerless for pity, or terror, or intense expectation of what is
to come.</p>
<p class="pn">At the same time its tendency, excepting in the
case of a few sensitive and tender spirits, is to deaden the
consciousness of guilt, to still the remonstrances of the
self-convicted mind, and to enable men of no religion and of no
morals to hear these doctrines proclaimed from the pulpit without
any salutary disquietude of heart. They do not really believe
them, or they find in them an apology for their corruption. It
has sometimes been said, by way of severe reflection, of a moral
sermon, that it could not be the Gospel, for that a Socinian
might have heard it without offence. The objection is very
absurd; but what then ought to be the inference drawn by the same
persons, respecting the character of doctrines which, although in
speculation they are fearful and appalling to the utmost, tend in
reality to stupify the moral sense, and can be listened to by the
profane and the profligate with complacency or apathy? While it
explains their popularity, it is a presumption against their
truth.</p>
<p class="pn">2. This doctrine has the recommendation of freeing
those who hold it from anxiety about the practical part of
religion, by substituting a system of belief <i>purely
speculative</i>. When examined in all its bearings, it may be
seen to consist of faith and assurance: faith in the divine
decrees; assurance of being numbered with the elect. Get clear
views of the divine sovereignty, believe that Christ died for
<i>you</i> in particular, construe the persuasion of your safety
into an especial witness of the Holy Spirit; doubt nothing, fear
nothing; look entirely out of yourselves; and remember that there
is a finished salvation for the elect; and all is well! This is
Calvinism. And this is speculation. If repentance,
self-government, virtue, and the duties of Christian piety and
obedience are inculcated, these must be enforced on grounds not
supplied by the predestinarian theology, and irreconcileable with
that scheme of doctrine. Doubtless, the best writers of this
school insist on holiness of temper, and sanctity of life, and
enforce these by motives derived from the moral perfections of
God, the turpitude of sin, and the necessity of a renewed heart
as being essential to religion here and happiness hereafter. But
all these considerations are totally independent of the
speculations of the fatalist, and are rendered powerless as
incentives to action exactly in proportion to the practical
influence of these speculations on the mind and the heart.</p>
<p class="pn">Let the professor of Christianity give up his
thoughts to eternal decrees, and special grace, and the soothing
dream of irrevocable promises sealed to the heart by the clear
witness of the Spirit, and the moral conflict with sin and
temptation will languish with the salutary fear of danger. This
is suited to the depraved indolence of man. All false systems of
religion have in view the indulgence of this perilous but
seductive peace. Any thing is acceptable to corrupt human nature
that supplies a substitute for the duties of moral righteousness
and a sublime virtue, lulling the conscience into a state of
artificial repose. And to produce this effect, no scheme of
religious belief, that ever emanated from the perverse ingenuity
of the human mind, was ever so perfectly contrived as the
Calvinistic notion of predestinating grace.</p>
<p class="pn">3. Of the multitudes of truly religious persons,
who embrace this doctrine or give their passive assent to it, but
few are competent to detect its fallacies, or to trace its evil
consequences.</p>
<p class="pn">They are to be found chiefly among the lower ranks
of life, or the uneducated portions of the middle and the higher
classes. If there are any whose minds have been disciplined by
sound instruction, and expanded by liberal acquirements, they
are, for the most part, the children of Calvinistic families,
who, having been taught to reverence these opinions in their
childhood, have not had energy of mind to rise above their early
impressions. That multitudes of persons piously disposed, but
without the requisite knowledge, or intellectual culture, should
be influenced by the arguments of men skilful in dialectics, and
zealous to make proselytes, cannot be deemed matter of
wonderment. Especially let it be noticed, that these teachers and
preachers know well how to appeal to ignorant timidity and to
sincere but unguarded piety.</p>
<p class="pn">They are told, that to reject these doctrines shows
“a heart secretly disaffected to the government of God,” and
daring to oppose presumption and ignorance to the wisdom of the
Eternal. As if it were not the fact, that Calvinism has been
viewed with abhorrence by men of the humblest and the purest
piety, by men of seraphic minds and of the sublimest
intellect.</p>
<p class="pn">They are also instructed to believe, that the grace
of the Redeemer is magnified by degrading human nature to the
utmost, and making the redeemed passive recipients of
predestinated and exclusive grace. But they do not perceive that
Calvinism destroys all ideas of <i>grace</i>, by making God the
author of the misery which He affects to pity, and by tracing the
divine conduct to mere motiveless caprice, to blind and arbitrary
choice or rejection.</p>
<p class="pns">These distinctions are lost upon the superficial
minds of the multitude. And when they are told that Calvinism
honours the sovereignty of God, and exalts the grace of Christ,
their religious and holy feelings are enlisted in a cause which
little deserves these high and evangelic eulogies. While the love
of God in Christ, to themselves in particular, is made the
prevailing topic, the gloomy and suspicious parts of the system
are kept in the back ground, or positively denied.</p>
<p class="pn">If there be truth in the preceding remarks, the
degree of popularity which attaches to this view of religion, far
from yielding a presumptive argument in its favour, is, at least,
a reason for regarding it with suspicion. It has not the
recommendation of being the faith of the most numerous portion of
the wise, of the holy, of the virtuous. It appeals to the
weaknesses rather than to the nobler principles of human nature.
It can never be the sincere and cherished belief of an
enlightened, community.</p>
<p class="pn">The advocates of this creed appear to be aware of
this, and therefore supply their want of conclusive argument by
fulminations intended to effect by fear, what more honourable
means could not accomplish.</p>
<p class="pn">They not only contend for the truth of their
doctrine, they make the belief of it essential to salvation. None
are elect who do not receive their views of election. All others
are reprobate. “Shall I tell you,” says one of their most eminent
men, “some of the ends that may be answered by preaching this
doctrine? One important end is, to detect hearts which are
unwilling that God should reign; to lay open those smooth,
selfish spirits, which, while they cry Hosannah, are hostile to
the dominion of Jehovah. The more fully God and the system of his
government are brought out to view, the more clearly are the
secrets of all hearts revealed.” Men, who fancy themselves
impelled by a “special influence” to receive this creed, may
consistently pronounce judgment on those who reject it. The
absurdity in one case, is not greater than in the other. But
their attempts at intimidation will have no other effect with
persons of dispassionate reflection, than to render more
repulsive those errors which foster insolent conceit in vulgar
minds, and encourage those who appear to have but a superficial
knowledge of themselves to pass sentence of condemnation on the
hearts of others.</p>
<p class="pn">Formally to disclaim a charge so gross and
misapplied as that of “hostility to the dominion of Jehovah,”
would be to treat it with more respect than it deserves. But it
may not be improper to remark, that the charge proceeds with the
worst possible grace from the vindicators of a creed which
obliterates from the divine government every trace of wisdom, of
rectitude, of goodness, and so represents the Ruler of the word,
as to make Him an object of detestation and terror to his
creatures. Other sentiments must inspire the heart before we can
reverence the divine administration, and unite in “the song of
Moses the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, Great
and marvellous are thy works, Lord God Almighty: <i>just</i> and
<i>true</i> are thy ways, Thou king of saints.”</p>

<div style="font-size:92%">
<p class="pch">ADDITIONAL REMARKS ON MR. NOEL’S TRACT ON “THE
UNITY OF THE CHURCH.”</p>
<p class="pnn">T<span class="sc">he</span> writer of these pages
has no personal knowledge of the author of the tract, of whom he
has only heard by report, that he is a zealous minister and
popular preacher. His writings indicate natural suavity of
temper. Having therefore no feeling of personal disrespect, he
deems no apology to be necessary for the freedom of his
strictures on a work which challenges attention and defies
contradiction.</p>
<p class="pn">Mr. Noel has openly and dogmatically set forth a
theory of the visible Church and her fellowship, not only hostile
to the Church of England and fraught with absurdity, but
propounded under the alluring guise of Christian charity; a
charity which has won for him the applause of the professors of
modern <i>liberalism</i>, because, on a cursory glance, it
appears to embrace all sects and denominations of Christians. It
is proper, therefore, to set the matter in a true light, by
showing that this liberality of sentiment is more specious than
real; that Mr. Noel is throwing out false colours, and that
while, in no measured terms, he condemns the supposed want of
brotherly-kindness in the members of the Church of England, his
own apparent liberality is resolvable into nothing else than
<i>Calvinistic exclusiveness and intolerance</i>.</p>
<p class="pn">Liberality is the order, the fashion, the idol of
the day. In many it takes the form of infidel indifference,
regarding as equally true, or equally false, every creed that is
called Christian.</p>
<p class="pn">The charity of our holy and Apostolical Church is
not thus lax and indiscriminate. It rests not upon scepticism,
but upon sound and definable principles. It does not proceed on
the assumption that all creeds are equally good, but that men of
all creeds have a political right to follow the dictates of
conscience, whether enlightened or erroneous, in matters purely
spiritual, and that they are responsible only to God for their
religious faith and worship; indulging, at the same time, a
charitable persuasion of the sincerity and Christian goodness of
multitudes who are believed to be labouring under mistaken views
of truth. This is true <i>Christian</i> charity, which tolerates
error, hopes well of misinformed but sincere piety, breathes no
malignant feelings, indulges in no haughtiness of conscious
superiority; but, after all, holds firmly to its own persuasion
of what is true and right, without the smallest approach to a
compromise of principles even with honest and well-meaning error.
This is the charity of the sound English churchman, and this
charity lies at the foundation of the religious liberties of the
British empire.</p>
<p class="pn">As churchmen we contemplate with reverence, our
protestant, episcopal, and apostolical communion. We believe that
it rests on “the foundation of Apostles and prophets, Jesus
Christ himself the chief corner-stone.” And we contend for the
right of the Church to demand from her own ministers faith in her
doctrines, and to model her own worship, and adjust her own
ceremonies according to her own holy discretion. But we compel no
man to come in. We love and cherish the chartered and
constitutional liberties of our country; and while we sympathize
not with the errors which are tolerated, we rejoice in the
freedom, the just and evangelic freedom, which leaves every man,
without control or interference, to settle all points of
<i>religious</i> duty with his conscience and his God. We do not
feel bound to attempt what would be impracticable, to construct a
church which should suit the caprices of all, and whose flexible
creed, like the vane which surmounts the steeple, should shift
with “<i>every wind of doctrine</i>;” but we allow the
discontented to depart without molestation, and we honour their
conscientious scruples, while we regret and condemn their
errors.</p>
<p class="pn">With charity so large yet discriminating, founded
on principles which approve themselves to the judgment and the
heart, we solemnly protest against every charge of intolerance
and bigotry that is brought, by friend or foe, against our
National Church.</p>
<p class="pn">But this does not satisfy Mr. Noel, who proposes,
what appears at first sight, a charity still more generous and
comprehensive. The Anti-pædobaptist and the Presbyterian, with
all their germane varieties, are not only to be treated with
forbearance and regarded with charity, but are all to form one
fellowship, united and co-operating in the great cause of their
common Christianity. Take the following passage. “And these”
<i>Baptism</i> and <i>Church government</i>, “are two of the most
important points which separate Christians. Should they separate
them? As well might the brothers of a family be separated by the
most trifling difference on some question of taste or literature.
. . . . . Episcopalians and Presbyterians, Baptists and
Pædobaptists, with all others, who differ on obscure and
undecided points, ought, if they have one Lord, one faith, one
baptism, one God, and one hope, under the influence of one
Spirit, who sanctifies them all, to be one in profession, in
action, and in heart.” This passage, which is in the spirit of
the entire tract, is open to grave animadversion.</p>
<p class="pn">1. The points mentioned as being “most trifling
differences,” are regarded by all theologians of any reputation
as questions of great moment, although not equally so with those
which immediately touch our salvation. Mr. Noel is altogether
original in regarding either the construction that is to be put
on the sacrament of baptism, or the degree of importance to be
attached to the episcopal office, as matters “most trifling.”</p>
<p class="pn">2. The Baptists and Presbyterians, who look on
these points with other feelings than those of Mr. Noel, have
considered them of sufficient moment to justify their separation
from the communion of our Church. That separation is <i>their
own</i> “act and deed.” And to charge the Church, on this
account, with bigotry, intolerance, and want of charity, proves
either consummate ignorance of ecclesiastical history, or
deliberate injustice to serve a party. Nevertheless, the entire
argument of the tract, proceeds on the assumption that the Church
is the guilty and impenitent party.</p>
<p class="pn">3. Under these circumstances, it is impossible that
there should be but “one profession,” unless one of the differing
parties can deny its own faith, and profess what it does not
believe. The Catholic Church of England cannot, and will not, be
guilty of that turpitude. The members of <i>Mr. Noel’s Church</i>
have declared, by their voluntary separation, their determination
to profess their own principles.</p>
<p class="pn">4. That which is most reprehensible in this
charitable project of hailing all sects as brethren is, that it
is, after all, deceptive and hollow. Mr. Noel does not intend a
promiscuous fellowship with various denominations. His charity is
extended to those, and to those exclusively, who, within these
several communions, hold “the doctrines of grace.” All others he
denounces as not being children of God. That is, his union
includes all those who think with himself; Calvinists of every
persuasion, and not a soul besides! These are his “one body,” and
this one body is “<span class="sc">the church</span>.” How
beautiful, how noble, how godlike is the charity of the Church of
England, which exists in unison with the love of truth, but
embraces with Christian affection even those who have quitted her
fellowship, contrasted with the drivelling and sectarian
partialities of the Calvinist who pronounces every man who
differs from himself to be no child of God! The charity of Mr.
Noel resolves itself into Calvinistic exclusiveness and
intolerance.</p>
<p class="pns">If in these remarks there is any apparent
severity, they are not to be applied to the author, but to the
principles of his work. Calvinism obscures the finest intellect,
and gives a false direction to the most humane and generous
feelings which can impart graceful dignity to the Christian
character.</p>

 Dr. Griffin in his “Lectures on Important Doctrines,” broadly
charges the rejectors of Calvinism with embracing <i>another
Gospel</i>, and with being on the high road to infidelity. “And
when they have gone this length,” he says, “in frittering away
man’s dependence on grace, they are just prepared to place him
completely on his own works, to deny justification by faith, and
of course, the proper influence of the atonement; short of this
these systems never stop: and when they have gone thus far, there
is but one step to a denial of the divinity of Christ and the
infinite demerit of sin. The next step is <i>universalism</i>,
and the next <i>infidelity</i>.” Every intelligent reader will
know how to appreciate this senseless dogmatism. The infidel
might with equal propriety charge the professors of Scriptural
Christianity with being on the high road to Calvinism, and
prepared, by their faith in the corruption of human nature, and
the atonement of Christ, for the most extreme views of the Divine
decrees. Yet these bold and baseless assertions have their weight
with those for whom they are intended, and many weak but good
persons are held in passive bondage to these teachers and their
creed, through the holy fear of moving a step towards infidelity.
On the other hand, we might retort the charge. Calvinism has made
more infidels than any other corruption of Christianity,
excepting Popery. But we suggest this only in the way of <i>fair
retaliation</i>.</p>
<p class="pns">The rejectors of Calvinism do not reject “the
doctrines of grace,” but the corruptions by which they have been
dishonoured. They maintain, that on the absolute predestinarian
scheme, there is no room for grace, such as the Gospel exhibits
to the sinful and the lost; and that their own views are not only
more accordant with the justice, but with the unmerited and
infinite mercy of God. They ascribe all true holiness to the
Divine Spirit.</p>
<p class="pn"><sup><a href="#f2" id="n2" name="n2">2</a></sup>
 Dr. Coplestone, now the Bishop of Llandaff, denies that the
foreknowledge of an event proves the <i>event to be
necessary</i>. “<i>We</i> may be unable to conceive how a thing
not necessary in its nature can be foreknown; for <i>our</i>
foreknowledge is in general limited by that circumstance, and is
more or less perfect in proportion to the fixed or necessary
nature of the things we contemplate, with which nature we become
acquainted by experience, and are thus able to anticipate a great
variety of events: but to subject the knowledge of God to any
such limitation is surely absurd and unphilosophical, as well as
impious; and, therefore, to mix up the idea of God’s
foreknowledge with any quality in the nature of the things
foreknown, is even less excusable than to be guilty of that
confusion when speaking of ourselves.”</p>
<p class="pn">But, with due deference to his lordship, this does
not contradict the statement in the text, that we are ignorant of
any principle on which <i>such prescience</i> can be explained.
Assuming, indeed, that any events are contingent, that human
actions proceed from freedom, and not from necessity, we cannot
deny that they come within the range of infinite knowledge.</p>
<p class="pns">But the philosophical necessarian does not grant
this postulate. He assumes the existence of an infinite mind, to
whose knowledge all events are open, and thence infers the
<i>necessity</i> of these events. He pleads that omniscience and
contingency are incongruous ideas, and, on the ground of pure
metaphysics, it would be difficult to refute him. But we demolish
his theory by an appeal to facts. We oppose the moral
constitution and history of man, to the plausible speculations of
philosophy. In other words, the mere metaphysician is a fatalist;
and his position, in the present state of our intellectual
philosophy, can be successfully attacked only by an appeal to
facts and consciousness, and by moral argument. That sound
metaphysics and just moral reasoning cannot really be at variance
is certain, since there cannot exist contradictory truths. Our
metaphysics therefore are wrong, or there must be an unknown
<i>third principle</i>, by which they are to be reconciled with
our moral reasonings. But until we can detect the fallacies of
the metaphysician, or supply the <i>connecting link</i> which is
now wanting, we must rest in the unsatisfactory conclusion that
abstract philosophy is with the necessarian, and that liberty and
its ennobling consequences, moral agency, and moral
responsibility, rest on the solitary basis of moral argument.</p>
<p class="pns"><sup><a href="#f3" id="n3" name="n3">3</a></sup>
 On the “special <i>teaching</i>” claimed, in connexion with
“special grace,” by the most popular writers of the Calvinistic
school, the reader may find some just and forcible remarks in
Essays by W. and T. Ludlam. Their fearless exposure of the
erroneous statements given by Milner, Robinson, Newton, Harvey,
and others, more particularly on the subject of divine influence,
awakened the indignation of a party whose pretensions, when
tested by reason and revelation, were proved to be groundless.
Without attempting an indiscriminate defence of their opinions or
their arguments, we may recommend these essays as being eminently
worthy of attention in the present day, when two distinct but
zealous parties are aiming to establish exclusive doctrines, by
discountenancing the legitimate use of human reason in religious
inquiries—one resting on tradition, the other on individual
inspiration; neither of them seeming to remember, that tradition
may be pleaded for and against the same dogmata, and that the
private persuasions of one good man may be opposite to those of
another, who has, with equal earnestness and humility, prayed to
be directed into the knowledge of saving truth. The man of
independent mind will find in these essays, much to admire in
their elucidation of truth and detection of error, but more in
their dauntless defiance of those who represent the Bible as a
“sealed book” to all who are not visited with a special faculty
for discerning its mystic characters and hidden sense. In that
case, the Scriptures are a revelation <i>only to the elect</i>,
who, to satisfy themselves and the world, that <i>their
interpretation</i> is the only sound one, ought to produce
miracles as proof of their own inspiration, not less unequivocal
than those which vindicated the authority and infallibility of
the Apostles. Such opinions, although held by religious men, are
dishonourable to the Scriptures, and needlessly degrading to the
human mind.</p>

“There can be no approaches towards regeneration in the
antecedent temper of the heart. The moment before the change, the
sinner is as far from sanctification, as darkness is from light,
as death is from life, as sin is from holiness.”</p>
<p class="pn">“Regeneration is an instantaneous change, from
exclusive attachment to the creature, from supreme selfishness,
from enmity against God, to universal love, which fixes the heart
supremely on Him; and there is no previous abatement of the
enmity, or approximation towards a right temper; the heart being
at one moment in full possession of its native selfishness and
opposition, at the next moment in possession of a principle of
supreme love to God; acquiring thus, in an instant, a temper
which it never possessed before.”—<i>Lectures on Important
Doctrines by Dr. Griffin</i>.</p>
<p class="pns">How extravagant in theory, how false in fact! The
doctrine of the Anglican Church on this; and all similar points,
never appears so wise, and sound, and scriptural, as when
contrasted with the speculative systems of men, who, to give
harmony and consistency to their notions, close their eyes to the
real world of man, and create for themselves an ideal universe,
peopled by another order of beings, and governed by a power
unknown but to the dreamers themselves.</p>

 The Presbyterian Church of Scotland is both Calvinistic and
National. But this fact does not militate against the argument of
this section; that Calvinism is opposed to the constitution and
purposes of a visible Church. Her creed and her discipline are at
variance. Her ministers are required to believe in the
Westminster Confession. And the great body of her people are said
to be attached to that system of doctrine. But her more educated
classes reject it, and the Scottish Church is a divided
house.</p>

 The prominent part taken by the doctrinal Puritans, in the
revolutionary movements which brought Charles I. to the block, is
proved by the concurrent testimony of the writers of those times.
It is amply illustrated and confirmed by Mr. Nichols in his
“Calvinism and Arminianism Compared.”</p>
<p class="pn">The “Memoirs of Colonel Hutchinson,” by his widow
Lucy, is not only a work of great general interest, beautifully
composed, and combining with the life of an eminent person vivid
sketches of the times; but it illustrates the subject discussed
in the text. Colonel Hutchinson was a doctrinal Puritan, and one
of the regicides. In himself we behold all the elements of a
great and noble character, devout, humane, scrupulously
conscientious, and of heroic courage; every quality that might
adorn the gentleman, the patriot, the Christian. But his extreme
principles induced a mistaken sense of duty, which embittered his
own days, and added to the calamities of his country; after
having been spared at the restoration, his gloomy reserve and
supposed readiness to act again the part of a rebel, if
opportunity should occur, led to his imprisonment in Sandown
Castle, where he died more ignobly than if he had been brought to
the block. It would have been more to the honour of the king, if
he had at first doomed him to a public execution, the proper
death of a regicide, or had left him afterwards unmolested; but
the second Charles was not less mean and malignant than his sire
was unfortunate. Of the character of the humbler class of the
doctrinal Puritans, the following hints are incidentally given in
this work.</p>
<p class="pn">The name of Roundhead “was very ill applied to Mr,
Hutchinson, who, having naturally a very fine thick sett head of
hair, kept it clean and handsome, so that it was a greate
ornament to him, although <i>the godly of those dayes</i>, when
he embrac’d their party, <i>would not allow him to be
religious</i>, because his hayre was not in their cutte, nor his
words in their phraze, nor such little formalities altogether
fitted to their humour; who were, many of them, so weake as to
esteeme rather for such insignificant circumstances, then for
solid wisdom, piety, and courage, which brought reall ayd and
honor to their party; but as Mr. Hutchinson chose, not them, but
the God they serv’d, and the truth and righteousness they
defended, so did not their weaknesses, censures, ingratitude, and
discouraging behaviour, with which he was abundantly exercised
all his life, make him forsake them in any thing wherein they
adher’d to just and honourable principles and practizes; but when
they apostatized from these, none cast them off with greater
indignation, how shining soever the profession were that gilt,
not a temple of living grace, but a tomb which only held the
carkase of religion.” In other words, like other partisans, whose
principles have degenerated into the spirit of faction, he
overlooked the baseness of ingratitude, and worse immoralities,
in his associates, so long as they maintained the just and
honourable character of traitors and rebels.</p>

 The Manchester Synod, at which were present 620 ministers of
various denominations, was held in the year 1841, for the purpose
of discussing the <i>corn laws</i>, with a view to their
abolition. The professed object was the relief of the poor by
procuring cheap bread; the real object was the depression of the
landed aristocracy, and, through them, of the Clergy of the
National Church, whose tithes are regulated by the average value
of corn. Had those gentlemen been sincere in their lamentations
for the manufacturing poor, they would have long ago agitated the
country for the abolition of the Factory System, and the rescue
of its miserable victims from oppression and famine. That system
must be strengthened by the abolition of the corn laws, which
would only aggrandize the <i>great manufacturers</i>, and plunge
the working people into deeper misery, by throwing the
agricultural poor out of employment, and driving them to the
towns and cities for occupation, thus glutting the market with
superfluous labour. Looking at some of those individuals who took
a leading part in the Synod, men of reputed truth and probity in
their customary habits, their disingenuousness on this occasion
supplies a striking proof of the power of faction to impair the
moral sense, especially when originating in hatred of the Church.
The great body of this Synod were ministers of Calvinistic
Churches. The “dissenting interest” has degraded itself by
assuming the character of a political faction.</p>
